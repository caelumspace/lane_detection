A simplified example of a lane detection algorithm in C++, using OpenCV. This example demonstrates the core steps commonly used in basic lane detection:

1. **Reading/Loading an Image** (or frame if you are working with a video stream).
2. **Preprocessing**: Grayscale conversion, Gaussian blur, Canny edge detection.
3. **Masking the Region of Interest** (ROI).
4. **Applying Hough Transform** to detect lines.
5. **Filtering and Visualizing** the detected lines on the original image.

### Explanation of Key Steps

1. **Grayscale**: Converting the color image to grayscale simplifies computations for edge detection.
2. **Gaussian Blur**: Reduces noise and detail, helping to detect prominent edges (e.g., lane lines) more clearly.
3. **Canny Edge Detection**: Finds edges by looking for areas of rapid intensity change in the image.
4. **Masking / Region of Interest**: Focuses on the portion of the image most likely to contain lane lines (e.g., the roadway). This reduces false positives from other edges in the scene.
5. **Hough Transform (HoughLinesP)**: Detects lines in the edge map. The probabilistic version (`HoughLinesP`) returns the endpoints of each detected line segment.
6. **Drawing Lines**: Overlays the detected line segments on the original image for visualization.

## Possible Enhancements

- **Perspective Transform**: “Bird’s eye” view can help when performing more advanced lane shape estimation.
- **Sliding Window / Polynomial Fitting**: Helps track curved lanes more robustly.
- **Clustering / Filtering Lines**: Group detected lines into “left” and “right” lane and average them out to eliminate noise.
- **Temporal Smoothing (for video)**: Use previous frame information to smooth out jitter and maintain consistent lane detection.
- **Machine Learning / Deep Learning**: For robust detection in varied lighting, complex road conditions, or occlusions.

This example should get you started with a straightforward lane detection pipeline. For real-world applications and consistent performance across different driving scenarios, you would continue refining each step, possibly employing more advanced techniques mentioned above.
